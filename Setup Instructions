Steps to Set Up Python Environment 

Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone my GitHub repository (if you haven't already).

git clone https://github.com/RominGandhi/Financial-Instruments-Predictive-Analytics-Portfolio-Optimization.git

Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to manage the project's dependencies.

On macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate


Step 3: Install Dependencies
Once your virtual environment is activated, install the required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file under src folder.

pip install -r requirements_final.txt

Step 4: Run the Project
Now that all dependencies are installed, you can run the project by executing the main.py file.

python main.py

Additional Information:

- requirements.txt: This file lists all the Python libraries that the project depends on. Running the pip install -r requirements_final.txt command ensures that all these libraries are installed in your environment.

- Virtual Environment: Using a virtual environment is highly recommended as it keeps the project's dependencies isolated from other projects and the global Python environment.

Step 5: Deactivate the Virtual Environment (Optional)
When you're done testing my project, you can deactivate the virtual environment.

deactivate
